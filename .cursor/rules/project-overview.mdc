# Eurovision Scoreboard Project Overview

This document provides an overview of the key files and architecture of the Eurovision Scoreboard application.

## State Management

The application's state is managed by two main stores using Zustand:

-   **`countriesStore.ts`**: Manages the list of countries for a given year, the selected countries for an event, and theme information. See [countriesStore.ts](mdc:src/state/countriesStore.ts).
-   **`scoreboardStore.ts`**: Manages the main event state, including voting, points, event phase (semi-finals, grand final), and the list of participating countries on the scoreboard. See [scoreboardStore.ts](mdc:src/state/scoreboardStore.ts).

## Event Setup Flow

The event setup is handled through a modal that allows the user to configure the contest mode and participating countries.

-   **`EventSetupModal.tsx`**: The main modal component that orchestrates the setup process. It contains the logic for switching between event modes and handling country assignments. See [EventSetupModal.tsx](mdc:src/components/setup/EventSetupModal.tsx).
-   **`SemiFinalsAndGrandFinalSetup.tsx`**: The component for configuring an event with semi-finals and a grand final. See [SemiFinalsAndGrandFinalSetup.tsx](mdc:src/components/setup/SemiFinalsAndGrandFinalSetup.tsx).
-   **`GrandFinalOnlySetup.tsx`**: The component for configuring a grand final-only event. See [GrandFinalOnlySetup.tsx](mdc:src/components/setup/GrandFinalOnlySetup.tsx).
-   **`CountrySelectionList.tsx`**: A reusable component for selecting and assigning countries to different groups (e.g., Semi-Final 1, Auto-Qualifier). See [CountrySelectionList.tsx](mdc:src/components/setup/CountrySelectionList.tsx).

## Core Data Models

The core data structures and enums for the application are defined in one place:

-   **`index.ts`**: Contains important enums like `EventMode`, `EventPhase`, and `CountryAssignmentGroup`, which define how the application behaves. See [index.ts](mdc:src/models/index.ts).

## Country Data

The data for participating countries for each year is stored in the `src/data/countries` directory. Each year has its own file (e.g., `countries-2024.ts`).
